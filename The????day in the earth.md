I came out a fancinating idea about how to start this story, but i just forget it, totally, without any lines remaining in my mind. Here is just something like: 

_"At the beginning i thought about we can start like this, but then i decided write about this."_

anyway, no matter beginning and then, i forgot, both.

i won't say maybe that's why my mother planet exciled me, because sure i know she wouldn't. and my poor memorise can contribute to this disgusting planet named earth. i do not mean the planet i mean the human.

actually i do made some friends here. i love the word alienate... iremember! that's my beginning, i decided start at alienate, what a genuis word! i love they treat me like alienate, i love be the one who rebelliate the rules which have nothing to do with my bornd nature, as you know im alien, i do always do creapy things, i do hate human, i do hard tolerent the sociaty. so what? just treat me like the one, just alienate me. 

**i hate you. i want go home.**

take me home.

now i feel tird. i barely remember what my mother planet looks like, i've been discarted for a long time. but i still know i don't belong to the earth. definately.

now its 02:26, i feel tird. i need sleep and the study. yes alien do study. tomorow i"ll talk about my mother plannet.
