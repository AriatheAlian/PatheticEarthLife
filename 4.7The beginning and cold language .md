 I finally made up my mind to write a blog.

 To be honest i do have time to create something here but i couldnt help to avoid it. its hard for me to start such a huge project, cause this alien-type life is too complex to figuer out, let alone write them down through language. I'm afaid that i can't describe it clearly so that cause some understanding for my sincere audience who shows a huge curiosity about this kind of life and would like to do some research on it. I really want show you the real thing.

 yes, the real. that's why i can't improve my blog work. it seems like i don't know how to portrait it, but the essence is, i even don't know what is real...the "real" real. i feel bad for it and i should make a pology to all my friend waiting my blog. I'm sorry, it's really hard for me, it's a torture, like all other thing. it's a torment.

 famouse. this is what i want to talk at first. even days ago i conceived a beginning for it but things happend like that i have to propo(? it. on the other hand im sure my dear audience would have question like: dear ariathealiana, where are you from? are you native english speaker? because your have already made enough misktakes on spelling words.

 that's what i want tell you, my dear friend, im avoid language. the english provides me a land, which is cold but flowers depicting emotional words are in full bloom.The language looks like a string of codes full of precise emotions, but generally cold.
 
as in “garden “

Cold cold cold

The white feathers are stained By scarlet, bloody red, the chicken whose head has been cut off, its blood flows in the dirty, numb hand. purity does not exist in the disgusting laughter. the shamful white sheded, the ridiculouse purity faded, everyone will go to hell in sin.

cold cold cold

This year, the winter never came. Eggs soured in their shells. The sky, pierced and torn, no longer sheltered the naked earth

cold cold cold

language garden

cold cold cold

try to make "myself" understood. i still have the pathetic humble wish. although the little alien have been in such despaire from a long time in unbearable and unfair infliction from the erath

is there really have audience? someone will ask, or your tulpa communicating with you to make you feel less lonely. 

yes, there is audience waiting for my blog. they are audience anology, more real than a material entity, a substance. they won't speak, so that i won't ifluenced by anyone, i won'd change my mind or change my writing for any stupid opinion. i hate gaze.

enough. i said enough. these stupid things are enough. let's talk about something more meaningful.
