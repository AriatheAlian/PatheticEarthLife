 I finally made up my mind to write a blog.

 To be honest i do have time to create something here but i couldnt help to avoid it. its hard for me to start such a huge project, cause this alien-type life is too complex to figuer out, let alone write them down through language. I'm afaid that i can't describe it clearly so that cause some understanding for my sincere audience who is curiouse about this kind of life and love to do some research on it. I really want show you the real thing.

 yes, the real. that's why i can't improve my blog work. it seems like i don't know how to portrait it, but the essence is, i even don't know what is real...the "real" real. i feel bad for it and i should make a pology to all my friend waiting my blog. I'm sorry, it's hard for me, it's torture, like all other thing. it's torment.

 famouse. this is what i want to talk at first. even days ago i conceived a beginning for it but things happend like that i have to propo(? it. im sure my dear audience would have question like: ##ariathealiana, why you use english, where are you from? are you native speaker because your have already wrote lots of errorous words.##
